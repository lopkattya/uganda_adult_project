Recent reserach has implicated microbiome as a factor that modulates protection against pathogen invasion and resistance to developing infectious diseases. Technological innovations have enabled researchers to simultaneously characterize the microbial and host transcriptomic profiles, allowing for the efficient study of interactions between microbial communities and their hosts. We hypothesize that transcriptomic profiling of microbes and host immune response in the upper respiratory tract will provide better understanding of mechanisms of defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection and disease. We propose to explore the role of the microbiome in determining resistance and susceptibility to MTB. We will assess host and microbial gene expression at the local site first exposed to MTB, the upper airway, specifically the nasal passages; these studies will be conducted in human populations susceptible and resistant to MTB infection and in those with TB. These studies may lead to novel TB diagnostics for early disease detection and to biomarkers for MTB resistance that will enable the development of more effective vaccines for MTB.
